# 📚 Annamarie Cortes — Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio!  
This repository showcases the key projects and enhancements I developed throughout my academic journey at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), culminating in the CS 499 Capstone course.

## 🌟 About This Portfolio

This ePortfolio was designed to demonstrate my technical growth, problem-solving skills, and software development expertise.  
It reflects my abilities across key areas of computer science: **software engineering**, **algorithms and data structures**, and **database optimization**.

Through iterative enhancements, I refined my featured project — a mobile ToDo List application — to meet industry-level expectations, improve user experience, and optimize system performance.

## 🛠️ Featured Project: ToDo List Mobile Application

**Originally created:** During coursework at SNHU  
**Primary Technologies:** Java (Android Development), SQLite (Local Database)

### Key Features:
- Add, edit, delete, and manage tasks with due dates, priorities, and categories
- Dynamic progress tracking via progress bar
- Local task storage using a structured and normalized SQLite database
- User-friendly UI designed with Material Design principles
- Dark Mode support based on device theme
